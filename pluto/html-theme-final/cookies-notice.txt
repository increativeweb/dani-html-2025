    <p>We use cookies and similar files or technologies on our Website <a href="https://pluto.security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://pluto.security/</a> (“<strong>Website</strong>“) to automatically collect and store information about your computer, device, and Website usage, in order to improve performance and enhance your user experience. In this notice, we use the general term “<strong>cookies</strong>” to refer to these and all similar technologies that collect information automatically when you use our Website where this notice is posted. You can find out more about cookies and how to control them in the information below.</p>
    <p>If you do not accept the use of these cookies, please disable them using the instructions in this Cookies Notice or by changing your browser settings so that cookies from this <strong>Website</strong> cannot be placed on your computer or mobile device. Important: disabling cookies on this Website may impair certain features.</p>
    <p>In this Cookies Notice (“<strong>Cookies Notice</strong>”), we use the term Pluto (and “<strong>we</strong>“, “<strong>us</strong>“, and “<strong>our</strong>“) to refer to Pluto Security Inc. Our Privacy Policy is available at <a href="https://resources.pluto.security/privacy_policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://resources.pluto.security/privacy_policy.pdf</a>.</p>
    <p class="h6"><strong>What is a cookie? </strong></p>
    <p>Cookies are computer files containing small amounts of information that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.&nbsp; Cookies can then be sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are widely used to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the website.</p>
    <p>Cookies perform many different functions, such as letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. Cookies may tell us, for example, whether you have visited our Website before or whether you are a new visitor.</p>
    <p>There are two broad categories of cookies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>First party cookies, </strong>served directly by us to your computer or mobile device.</li>
        <li><strong>Third party cookies, </strong>which are served by a third party on our behalf. These third-party cookies are outside of our control. The third parties may, at any time, change their terms of service, purpose, and use of cookies, etc. See below for additional information on how to manage such cookies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are ‘session cookies’, meaning that they exist only while your browser is open. These are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are ‘persistent cookies’, meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. They can be used by websites to recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again.</p>
    <p><strong>Web beacons. </strong>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, such as web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”). These are small graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our <strong>Website</strong>. A tracking pixel is a hyperlink to a resource, usually an image file, embedded into a piece of content like a website or an email. This pixel usually serves no purpose related to the content itself; its sole purpose is to establish a communication by the Pluto to the host of the pixel. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve website performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns.</p>
    <p><strong>Targeted advertising. </strong>Third parties may drop cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details, or other personally identifying details unless you choose to
        provide these to us.</p>
    <p class="h6"><strong>What types of cookies do we use?</strong></p>
