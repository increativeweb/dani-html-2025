                        <p>Cookies are computer files containing small amounts of information that are downloaded to
                            your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.&nbsp; Cookies can then be sent
                            back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that
                            recognizes that cookie. Cookies are widely used to make websites work, or to work more
                            efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the website.</p>
                        <p>Cookies perform many different functions, such as letting you navigate between pages
                            efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience.
                            Cookies may tell us, for example, whether you have visited our Website before or whether
                            you are a new visitor.</p>
                        <p>There are two broad categories of cookies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>First party cookies, </strong>served directly by us to your computer or
                                mobile device.</li>
                            <li><strong>Third party cookies, </strong>which are served by a third party on our
                                behalf. These third-party cookies are outside of our control. The third parties may,
                                at any time, change their terms of service, purpose, and use of cookies, etc. See
                                below for additional information on how to manage such cookies.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some
                            cookies are ‘session cookies’, meaning that they exist only while your browser is open.
                            These are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are
                            ‘persistent cookies’, meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. They can
                            be used by websites to recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the
                            Internet again.</p>
                        <p><strong>Web beacons. </strong>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors
                            to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, such as web
                            beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”). These are small graphics
                            files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has
                            visited our <strong>Website</strong>. A tracking pixel is a hyperlink to a resource,
                            usually an image file, embedded into a piece of content like a website or an email. This
                            pixel usually serves no purpose related to the content itself; its sole purpose is to
                            establish a communication by the Pluto to the host of the pixel. This allows us, for
                            example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our website to
                            another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to
                            our website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve
                            website performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns.</p>
                        <p><strong>Targeted advertising. </strong>Third parties may drop cookies on your computer or
                            mobile device to serve advertising through our Website. These companies may use
                            information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant

                            employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. The
                            information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your
                            name, contact details, or other personally identifying details unless you choose to
                            provide these to us.</p>
