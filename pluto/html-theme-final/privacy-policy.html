                            Used</strong></p>
                    <p>(i) <strong>We Process the Following Personal Information</strong>: <br>a. Personal information
                        provided through the Website. <br>a. When you visit and use the Website, we collect and process
                        your full name and email address and any other information that you decide to provide us with.
                        <br>b. When you make a request for us to search for websites related to your domain, we collect
                        your business email address. <br>b. Personal information provided through the Services. We
                        collect personal information that you voluntarily provide, including your full name, email
                        address, username and password, as well as any other personal information that you decide to
                        provide us with. We also collect the contact and billing information of our customers. <br>c.
                        Personal information automatically collected. We automatically collect certain information
                        through your use of Pluto’s Services and Website, such as cookie, pixels, tracking technologies
                        and similar identifiers (“Technologies”), your Internet protocol (IP) address, and other device
                        identifiers that are automatically assigned to your device, browser type and language, hardware
                        type, operating system, internet service provider and other personal information about actions
                        taken through the use of the Services and Website. <br>d. Personal information from Other
                        Sources. Pluto also may obtain information about you from other sources, including publicly - or

                        service providers. Pluto also maintains a database of low-code/no-code applications and websites
                        that are publicly available online. We collect this information by using automated tools to
                        identify applications associated with corporate domains. The information we collect may include
                        metadata from publicly available websites and applications, the domain under which the
                        application was created and creator information if it is publicly available in metadata or code.
                        <br>e. Personal information you provide to us in person. For example, when you visit one of our
                        exhibition booths or attend one of our events and you provide us with your contact details.
                        <br>f. Personal information we collect from online interactions. For example, if you attend a
                        webinar, contact us via social media or otherwise interact with our business, including as a
                        representative of a current / prospective customer, supplier or partner, we track and make a
                        record of those interactions, which may contain your contact details, such as full name, email
                        address, messages and any other personal information that you decide to provide us with.</p>
                    <p>(ii) <strong>We process personal information for the following purposes</strong>: <br>g. To allow

                    <p>2.1. Security. We implement and maintain industry-standard technical, organizational and security
                        measures designed to protect your personal information. However, please note that we cannot
                        guarantee that the personal information will not be compromised as a result of unauthorized
                        penetration of our servers. As the security of information depends in part on the security of
                        the computer, device or network you use to communicate with us and the security you use to
                        protect your user IDs and passwords, please make sure to take appropriate measures to protect
                        this information. <br>2.2. Retention of your personal information. Your personal information
                        will be stored until we proactively delete it from our records, or until you send a valid
                        deletion request. Please note that in some circumstances we store your personal information for
                        longer periods of time, for example (i) where we are required to do so in accordance with legal,
                        regulatory, tax or accounting requirements, or (ii) for us to have an accurate record of your
                        dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, and/or (iii) if we reasonably
                        believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal information or dealings.</p>

                        the foregoing events (including, without limitation, our current or potential investors). In the
                        event that we are acquired by, or merged with, a third party entity, or in the event of
                        bankruptcy or a comparable event, we reserve the right to transfer, disclose or assign your
                        personal information in connection with the foregoing events. <br>3.8. Where you have otherwise

                    <p class="h6"><strong>4. Your Privacy Rights</strong></p>
                    <p>4.1. The following rights (which may be subject to certain exemptions or derogations) shall apply
                        to certain individuals (some of which only apply to individuals protected by specific laws):
                        <br>i. You have the right to request access to your personal information held by us, along with
                        details on how it is processed, subject to certain conditions. You have the right to request
                        rectification of inaccurate personal information about you. <br>ii. You have the right to the
                        erasure of personal information about you (your “right to be forgotten”) under certain
                        conditions. <br>4.2. You can exercise your rights by contacting us at privacy@pluto.security.
                        You may use an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf if you provide the authorized
                        agent written permission signed by you. To protect your privacy, we may take steps to verify
                        your identity before fulfilling your request. Subject to legal and other permissible
                        considerations, we will make every reasonable effort to honor your request promptly in
                        accordance with applicable law or inform you if we require further information in order to
                        fulfil your request. When processing your request, we may ask you for additional information to
                        confirm or verify your identity and for security purposes, before processing and/or honoring
                        your request. We reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law, for instance if your
                        request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In the event that your request would adversely
                        affect the rights and freedoms of others (for example, would impact the duty of confidentiality
                        we owe to others) or if we are legally entitled to deal with your request in a different way
                        than initial requested, we will address your request to the maximum extent possible, all in
                        accordance with applicable law. <br>4.3. Marketing emails - opt-out: You may choose not to
                        receive marketing email by unsubscribing link found at the bottom of the email to opt out of
                        receiving future emails, and we will process your request within a reasonable time after
                        receipt.</p>

                        protected by executing data onward transfer instruments such as data processing and protection
                        agreements.</p>

                        guardian. In the event that we become aware that you provided personal information in violation
                        of applicable privacy laws, we reserve the right to delete it. If you believe that we might have
                        any such information, please contact us at privacy@pluto.security.</p>
                    <p class="h6"><strong>7. Interaction With Third Party Products.</strong></p>

                        services that are not owned, or controlled, by us (each, a “Third Party Service”). We are not
                        responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Third Party Services. Please be
                        aware that Third Party Services can collect personal information from you. Accordingly, we
