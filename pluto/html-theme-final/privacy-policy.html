                        <li><strong>Governing Law and Place of Jurisdiction. </strong>This Agreement (including without
                            limitation its validity and formation) shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
                            with, the laws of the State of State of Israel, without regard to any conflicts of laws
                            rules or principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
                            of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act shall not apply to this
                            Agreement and are hereby disclaimed. The competent courts of the city of Tel Aviv-Yaffo
                            shall have the exclusive jurisdiction with respect to any dispute and action arising under
                            or in relation to this Agreement.</li>
                        <li>If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
                            invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, then: (a) the remaining provisions of this Agreement
                            shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) such affected provision shall be ineffective
                            solely as to such jurisdiction (and only to the extent and for the duration of such
                            invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability), and shall be substituted (in respect of such
                            jurisdiction) with a valid, legal, and enforceable provision that most closely approximates
                            the original legal intent and economic impact of such provision.</li>
                        <li>Except as may be expressly stated otherwise in this Agreement, no right or remedy conferred
                            upon or reserved by any party under this Agreement is intended to be, or shall be deemed,
                            exclusive of any other right or remedy under this Agreement, at law or in equity, but shall
                            be cumulative of such other rights and remedies.</li>
                        <li>No failure or delay on the part of any party in exercising any right or remedy under this
                            Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
                            such right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
                            other right or remedy. Any waiver granted hereunder must be in writing (for waivers by you,
                            emails will be acceptable; for waivers by Pluto, the writing must be duly signed by an
                            authorized representative of Pluto), and shall be valid only in the specific instance in
                            which given.</li>
                        <li><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement represents the entire agreement between
                            Pluto and you with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and replaces any and
                            all prior and contemporaneous oral and/or written agreements, understandings and statements
                            between you and Pluto with respect to such subject matter. You acknowledge and agree that in
                            entering into this Agreement you have not relied on any statement or representation (whether
                            negligently or innocently made) not expressly set out in this Agreement; for example,
                            statements and explanations in any FAQs or other marketing material on the Site are for
                            convenience only, and are not binding or a part of this Agreement.</li>
